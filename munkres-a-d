\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Definition of $\R$ p. 31.} The object $\R$ is defined by assuming that there exists a set $\R$ having certain properties. We take this assumption for granted. Then it is easy to see that there are several sets having these properties. So, let $\R'$ be a set having the same properties as $\R$. Let $\Z_+',\Z'$ and $\Q'$ be to $\R'$ what $\Z_+,\Z$ and $\Q$ are to $\R$. 

\begin{thm}\label{Tumf}
There is a unique morphism of fields from $f:\R\to\R'$. This morphism is an isomorphism of ordered fields, and it induces isomorphisms $\Z_+\to\Z_+',\Z\to\Z'$ and $\Q\to\Q'$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{lem}\label{Lgh}
There is a unique map $g:\Z_+\to\Z_+'$ such that $g(0)=0$ and $g(n+1)=g(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+$. Similarly, there is a unique map $h:\Z_+'\to\Z_+$ such that $h(0)=0$ and $h(n+1)=h(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+'$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{proof} 
For $i\in\Z_+$ and $\varphi:\{1,\ldots,i\}\to\Z_+'$ define $\rho(\varphi)\in\Z_+'$ by $\rho(\varphi):=\varphi(i)+1$. Then the first statement follows from the Principle of Recursive Definition (Theorem~\ref{TPRD} p.~\pageref{TPRD}). The proof of the second statement is similar. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Tumf}] 
In the notation of Lemma \ref{Lgh}, set $u:=h\circ g$. Then $u:\Z_+\to\Z_+$ satisfies $u(0)=0$ and $u(n+1)=u(n)+1$ for all $n$ in $\Z_+$. One can easily prove that $u(n)=n$ by induction. The same argument works for $g\circ h$. This shows that $g:\Z_+\to\Z_+'$ and $h:\Z_+'\to\Z_+$ are inverse isomorphisms. Then we extend $g$ to morphisms $\Z\to\Z'$ and $\Q\to\Q'$, and similarly for $h$, and, arguing as before, we show that these morphisms are isomorphisms. More precisely, we see that there is a unique morphism $\Z\to\Z'$ extending $g$, and that this morphism is an isomorphism, and similarly for the morphism $\Q\to\Q'$. So we can make the identifications $\Z_+=\Z_+',\Z=\Z',\Q=\Q'$. To show that there is a unique morphism of fields $\R\to\R'$, and that this morphism is an isomorphism (inducing the identity of $\Q$), we argue as in Section \emph{Appendix to Chapter~1} in \emph{A few comments about ``Principles of Mathematical Analysis'' by Rudin}, available at \url{https://zenodo.org/records/13955297}. 
\end{proof} \smallskip

\noi\textbf{Theorem 7.8. p. 50 of the book.} Recall the statement: 

\begin{thm}[Theorem 7.8. p. 50 of the book]
Let $A$ be a set. There is no injective map $f : \mathcal{P}(A) \to A$, and there is no surjective map $g : A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$.
\end{thm} 

Here is my favourite way of phrasing the argument showing that there is no surjective map $g : A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$. Let $g : A \to \mathcal{P}(A)$ be a map, and set $B:=\{a\mid a\notin g(a)\}$, so that we have, for all $a$ in $A$, 
$$
a\in B\iff a\notin g(a).
$$ 
Let $a_0$ be in $A$. If we had $g(a_0)=B$, we would get, for all $a$ in $A$, 
$$
a\in g(a_0)\iff a\notin g(a),
$$ 
and we immediately that setting $a:=a_0$ yields a contradiction. This shows that $B$ is not in the range of $g$.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 7.6. p. 51 of the book.} We say that two sets $A$ and $B$ \textbf{have the same cardinality} if there is a bijection of $A$ with $B$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that if $B \subset A$ and if there is an injection
    \[
    f: A \to B,
    \]
    then $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality. [Hint: Define $A_1 = A, B_1 = B$, and for $n > 1$, $A_n = f(A_{n-1})$ and $B_n = f(B_{n-1})$. (Recursive definition again!) Note that $A_1 \supset B_1 \supset A_2 \supset B_2 \supset A_3 \supset \cdots$ Define a bijection $h: A \to B$ by the rule
    \[
    h(x) = \begin{cases} 
    f(x) & \text{if } x \in A_n\sm B_n \text{ for some } n, \\
    x & \text{otherwise}.]
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \item[(b)] \textit{Theorem (Schroeder-Bernstein theorem).} If there are injections $f: A \to C$ and $g: C \to A$, then $A$ and $C$ have the same cardinality.
\end{enumerate} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} (a) We will freely use the following two obvious facts: 

(F1) For $x\in A$ and $n\in\Z_+$ we have 
$$
x\in A_n\iff f(x)\in A_{n+1}\text{ and }x\in B_n\iff f(x)\in B_{n+1}.
$$ 

(F2) We have $\bigcap_{n\ge1}A_n=\bigcap_{\ge1}B_n=:I$. 

\noi Setting $A_n':=A_n\sm B_n,B_n':=B_n\sm A_{n+1}$, we get 
$$
A=\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}A_n'\right)\cup\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\right)\cup I,
$$ 
and this union is disjoint. We also have 
$$
B=\left(\bigcup_{n\ge2}A_n'\right)\cup\left(\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\right)\cup I.
$$ 
The injection $f$ induces bijections $f_n:A_n'\to A_{n+1}'$ (here we are using (F1)). To define a bijection $h:A\to B$, it suffices to define three bijections 
$$
u:\bigcup_{n\ge1}A_n'\to\bigcup_{n\ge2}A_n',\quad v:\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n'\to\bigcup_{n\ge1}B_n',\quad w:I\to I.
$$ 
We define $u$ by $u(x)=f_n(x)$ if $x\in A_n'$, and take $v$ and $w$ to be the identity maps. 

\noi(b) We set $B:=g(C)\subset A$ and define $f':A\to B$ by $f'(a):=g(f(a))$. Then $f':A\to B$ satisfies the assumptions for $f:A\to B$ in (a).

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 8.7. p. 56 of the book.} Prove Theorem 8.4 p. 54. 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} Recall the statement of Theorem~8.4. 

\begin{thm}[Principle of Recursive Definition, Theorem 8.4 of the book]\label{TPRD}
Let $A$ be a set; let $a_0$ be an element of $A$. Suppose $\rho$ is a function that assigns, to each function $f$ mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into $A$, an element of $A$. Then there exists a unique function
\[h: \mathbb{Z}^+ \to A\]
such that
\[
\begin{aligned}
h(1) &= a_0,\\
h(i) &= \rho(h|{\{1,\ldots,i-1\}}) \text{ for } i > 1.
\end{aligned}
\tag{$*$}
\]
\end{thm}

The formula $(*)$ is called a recursion formula for $h$. It specifies $h(1)$, and it expresses the value of $h$ at $i > 1$ in terms of the values of $h$ for positive integers less than $i$. 

The book gives a detailed proof of the particular case when $\rho(h|{\{1,\ldots,i-1\}})$ is equal to $\min(C\sm h(\{1,\ldots,i-1\}))$, where ``$\min$'' means ``\emph{minimum}'', and $C$ is an infinite set. A close inspection of this proof reveals that the sole property of the element $c$ of $C$ defined by the equality $c:=\min(C\sm h(\{1,\ldots,i-1\}))$ is that it depends only on the restriction $h|{\{1,\ldots,i-1\}}$. This implies that, if, in the proof given by the book, we replace ``$\min(C\sm h(\{1,\ldots,i-1\}))$'' with ``$\rho(h|{\{1,\ldots,i-1\}})$'', then we obtain a proof of Theorem~\ref{TPRD}.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 10.7 p. 67.} Let $J$ be a well-ordered set. A subset $J_0$ of $J$ is said to be \textbf{inductive} if for every $\alpha \in J$,
\[(S_\alpha \subset J_0) \Rightarrow \alpha \in J_0.\] 

\begin{thm}[The Principle of Transfinite Induction]\label{TPTI1}
If $J$ is a well-ordered set and $J_0$ is an inductive subset of $J$, then $J_0 = J$. 
\end{thm} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} If $J_0\ne J$, let $\alpha$ be the least element of $J\sm J_0$. We get $S_\alpha \subset J_0$, and thus $\alpha \in J_0$, contradiction. 

\hs

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Exercise 10.10 p. 67 of the book.} Prove the following Theorem:  

\noi\textbf{Theorem.} Let $J$ and $C$ be well-ordered sets; assume that there is no surjective function mapping a section of $J$ onto $C$. Then there exists a unique function $h: J \to C$ satisfying the equation
\[h(x) = \min(C\sm h(S_x)) \tag{$\ast$}
\]
for each $x \in J$, where $S_x$ is the section of $J$ by $x$. 

\noi\textbf{Solution.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] If $h$ and $k$ map sections of $J$, or all of $J$, into $C$ and satisfy ($\ast$) for all $x$ in their respective domains, show that $h(x) = k(x)$ for all $x$ in both domains.

\item[(b)] If there exists a function $h: S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying ($\ast$), show that there exists a function $k: S_\alpha \cup \{\alpha\} \to C$ satisfying ($\ast$).

\item[(c)] If $K \subset J$ and for all $\alpha \in K$ there exists a function $h_\alpha: S_\alpha \to C$ satisfying ($\ast$), show that there exists a function
\[k: \bigcup_{\alpha \in K} S_\alpha \to C\]
satisfying ($\ast$).

\item[(d)] Show by transfinite induction that for every $\beta \in J$, there exists a function $h_\beta: S_\beta \to C$ satisfying ($\ast$). [Hint: If $\beta$ has an immediate predecessor $\alpha$, then $S_\beta = S_\alpha \cup \{\alpha\}$. If not, $S_\beta$ is the union of all $S_\alpha$ with $\alpha < \beta$.]

\item[(e)] Prove the theorem.
\end{enumerate} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} 

\noi(a) Otherwise there would be a least $x$ such that $h(x)\ne k(x)$, we would get $h(S_x)=k(S_x)$, and $(*)$ would yield a contradiction. 

\noi(b) We define $k$ by $k(x)=h(x)$ if $x<\alpha$ and $k(x)=\min(C\sm h(S_x))$ if $x=\alpha$, and verify that $k$ satisfies $(*)$. 

\noi(c) Set $k(x)=h_\alpha(x)$ if $x\in S_\alpha$. To show that $k(x)$ is well defined, we must check that $\beta>\alpha$ implies $h_\beta(x)=h_\alpha(x)$. But this follows from (a). 

\noi(d) Let $I$ be the set of all $\beta\in J$ such that there is a map $h_\beta:S_\beta\to C$ satisfying $(*)$. It suffices to show that $I$ is inductive. So, assume that $\beta$ is in $J$ and that $S_\beta\subset I$. We must show $\beta\in I$. To do that, we use (b) if $\beta$ has an immediate predecessor, and we use (c) if not. 

\noi(e) We define $h$ by 
$$
h(x)=
\begin{cases}
\min(C\sm h_x(S_x))&\text{if }x=\max(J)\\ 
h_{x+1}(x)&\text{if }x\ne\max(J),
\end{cases} 
$$ 
where ``$x\ne\max(J)$'' means ``$x\ne\max(J)$ if $J$ has a maximum'', and $x+1$ is the least element greater than $x$. Let us show that $h$ satisfies $(*)$, that is, $h(x)=\min(C\sm h(S_x))$. We can assume $x\ne\max(J)$ (in the above sense). We must show $h_{x+1}(x)=\min(C\sm h(S_x))$. Since we have $h_{x+1}(x)=\min(C\sm h_{x+1}(S_x))$ by (d) it suffices to prove $h(S_x)=h_{x+1}(S_x)$. Let $y$ be in $S_x$, that is, $y\in J$ and $y<x$. It is enough to verify $h(y)=h_{x+1}(y)$, that is, $h_{y+1}(y)=h_{x+1}(y)$. We have $y+1<x+1$, and thus $S_{y+1}\subset S_{x+1}$, and (a) implies $h_{x+1}|S_{y+1}=h_{y+1}$. This proves $h_{y+1}(y)=h_{x+1}(y)$, which is what we wanted.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Supplementary Exercise 11.1 p. 72 of the book.} 

\begin{thm}[General principle of recursive definition]\label{TGPRD1}
Let $J$ be a well-ordered set; let $C$ be a set. Let $\mc F$ be the set of all functions mapping sections of $J$ into $C$.
Given a function $\rho:\mc F\to C$, there exists a unique function $h:J\to C$ such
that $h(\alpha)=\rho(h|S_\alpha)$ for each $\alpha\in J$. 
\end{thm} 

\noi[Hint: Follow the pattern outlined in Exercise 10 of Â§10.] 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} A close inspection of the solution to Exercise 10 of Â§10 reveals that the sole property of the element $c$ of $C$ defined by the equality $c:=\min(C\sm h(S_x))$ is that it depends only on the restriction $h|S_x$. This implies that, if, in the proof given by the book, we replace ``$\min(C\sm h(S_x))$'' with ``$\rho(h|S_x)$'', then we obtain a proof of Theorem~\ref{TGPRD1}.

\noi Here is a slightly different way of proving the General Principle of Recursive Definition. We state and prove Theorem~\ref{TGPTI} below, which we call General Principle of Transfinite Induction, and which generalizes both the usual Principle of Transfinite Induction (Exercise 10.7 p.~67 of the book and Theorem~\ref{TPTI1} p.~\pageref{TPTI1}. above) and the General Principle of Recursive Definition (Supplementary Exercise 1 p.~72 of the book and Theorem~\ref{TGPRD1} above). 

For each ordered set $X$ and each $x$ in $X$ we denote the subset $\{y\in X\ |\ y<x\}$ by $X(x)$. (This is the so-called \emph{section by} $x$.) Let $X$ be a well-ordered set, let $A$ be a set, let 
$$
\rho:\bigcup_{x\in X}A^{X(x)}\to A,
$$ 
where $A^{X(x)}$ stands for the set of all maps from $X(x)$ to $A$. (Note that the sets $A^{X(x)}$ with $x$ in $X$ are disjoint.) 

\begin{thm}[General Principle of Recursive Definition]\label{TGPRD2}
There is a unique map $f:X\to A$ such that $f(x)=\rho(f|X(x))$ for all $x$ in $X$. 
\end{thm} 

The main ingredient to prove Theorem \ref{TGPRD2} is 

\begin{thm}[General Principle of Transfinite Induction]\label{TGPTI}
If $P(X)$ is a property that a well-ordered set $X$ may or may not have, and if $P(X)$ holds whenever $P(X(x))$ holds for all $x$ in $X$, then $P(X)$ holds for all well-ordered set $X$. 
\end{thm} 

Before proving Theorem \ref{TGPTI} recall the usual Principle of Transfinite Induction: 

\begin{thm}[Principle of Transfinite Induction]\label{TPTI2} 
Let $U$ be a well-ordered set. If $Q(u)$ is a property that an element $u$ of $U$ may or may not have, and if $Q(u)$ holds whenever $Q(v)$ holds for all $v<u$, then $Q(u)$ holds for all $u$ in $U$. 
\end{thm} 

This is Exercise 10.7 p. 67 of the book. 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{TGPTI}] 
Let $X$ be a well-ordered set. We assume that $P(X)$ holds whenever $P(X(x))$ holds for all $x$ in $X$, and we want to prove $P(X)$. Let $\mc D$ be the set of all downward closed subsets of $X$. Then we have $\mc D=\{X(x)\ |\ x\in X\}\cup\{X\}$, and $X(x)\subsetneq X(y)$ if and only if $x<y$, and $X(x)\subsetneq X$ for all $x$, and $\mc D$ is well-ordered by proper inclusion. We want to apply the Principle of Transfinite Induction (Theorem~\ref{TPTI2}). To this end we set $U:=\mc D$ and, for $D\in\mc D$ we define $Q(D)$ as being $P(D)$. Then Theorem~\ref{TPTI2} tells us that $P(D)$ holds for all $D$ in $\mc D$, and thus in particular for $D=X\in\mc D$. 
\end{proof} 

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{TGPRD2}] 
We denote the statement of Theorem \ref{TGPRD2} by $P(X)$, and we want to apply Theorem~\ref{TGPTI}. So we assume that $P(X(x))$ holds for all $x$ in $X$. It suffices to prove $P(X)$. 

Case 1: $X$ has a largest element $\infty\in X$. By assumption, for all $x<\infty$ there is a unique map $f_x:X(x)\to A$ such that $f(y)=\rho(f|X(y))$ for all $y<x$. It is easy to check that each $f_x$ is the restriction of $f_\infty$ to $X(x)$, and that, if we define $f:X\to A$ by $f(\infty):=\rho(f_\infty)$ and $f(x):=f_\infty(x)$ if $x<\infty$, then $f$ is the unique solution to our problem. 

Case 2: $X=\bigcup_{x\in X}X(x)$. We have maps $f_x:X(x)\to A$ as above, and it is easy to check that that map $f:X\to A$ defined by $f(x):=f_{x+1}(x)$, where $x+1$ is the successor of $x$, is the unique solution to our problem. 
\end{proof} 

To see why the General Principle of Transfinite Induction (Theorem~\ref{TGPTI}) generalizes the Principle of Transfinite Induction (Theorem~\ref{TPTI2}), note that we can define $P(X)$ in terms of the $Q(u)$ by decreeing the $P(X)$ holds if and only if 
$$
\Big((\exists\ u\in U)\ \big(X=U(u)\big)\Big)\implies Q(u).
$$ \hrule\medskip

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Supplementary Exercise 11.2 p. 72 of the book.} 

\noi(a) Let $J$ and $E$ be well-ordered sets; let $h: J \to E$. Show the following two statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(i)] $h$ is order preserving and its image is $E$ or a section of $E$.
    \item[(ii)] $h(\alpha) = \text{smallest }[E - h(S_\alpha)]$ for all $\alpha$.
\end{enumerate}
[Hint: Show that each of these conditions implies that $h(S_\alpha)$ is a section of $E$; conclude that it must be the section by $h(\alpha)$.]

\noindent (b) If $E$ is a well-ordered set, show that no section of $E$ has the order type of $E$, nor do two different sections of $E$ have the same order type. [Hint: Given $J$, there is at most one order-preserving map of $J$ into $E$ whose image is $E$ or a section of $E$.] 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} 

\noi(a) For all $X\subset E$ set $X^c:=E\sm X$. For the sake of prudence, we change (ii) to: 

\noi(ii') $h(S_x)\ne E$ and $h(x)=\min(h(S_x)^c)$ for all $x$. 

\noi We want to show that (i) and (ii') are equivalent. 

\noi(i) implies (ii'). We prove $h(S_x)\ne E$ by noting that $h(S_x)=E$ we would entail $h(x)=h(y)$ for some $y<x$, contradiction. To prove $h(x)=\min(h(S_x)^c)$, assume by contradiction that we have $h(x)\ne\min(h(S_x)^c)=:e$. If $h(x)<e$, then $h(x)\notin h(S_x)^c$, that is, $h(x)\in h(S_x)$, and we reach a contradiction as above. If $e<h(x)$, then $e=h(y)$ for some $y<x$, that is, $\min(h(S_x)^c)=e=h(y)\in h(S_x)$, contradiction. 

\noi(ii') implies (i). We assume (ii'), and, in particular, that $h$ is weakly increasing. To show that $h$ is increasing, suppose $x<y$ and $h(x)=h(y)$ (we cannot have $h(x)>h(y)$ because $h$ is weakly increasing). Since $h(x)=h(y)=\min(h(S_y)^c)$, we have $h(x)\in h(S_y)^c$, but $h(x)\in h(S_y)$, contradiction. Finally, $h(J)$ is downward closed because $e<h(x)=\min(h(S_x)^c)$ implies $e\in h(S_x)\subset h(J)$. 

In the statement of the Exercise, the condition that $J$ is well-ordered can be changed from an assumption to a conclusion. 

\noi(b) Let $a$ be in $E$, and assume there is an isomorphism of well-ordered sets $h:S_a\to E$. It suffices to derive a contradiction. Let $i:S_a\to E$ be the inclusion. By (a) $h$ and $i$ satisfy the same recursion relation. By the Theorem about the General Principle of Definition by Recursion, we have $h=i$, and thus $a\in h(S_a)=i(S_a)=S_a$, contradiction.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Supplementary Exercise 11.3 p. 73 of the book.} Let $J$ and $E$ be well-ordered sets; suppose there is an order-preserving map $k: J \to E$. Using Exercises 1 and 2, show that $J$ has the order type of $E$ or a section of $E$. [Hint: Choose $e_0 \in E$. Define $h: J \to E$ by the recursion formula
\[h(\alpha) = \text{smallest }[E - h(S_\alpha)] \text{ if } h(S_\alpha) \neq E,\]
and $h(\alpha) = e_0$ otherwise. Show that $h(\alpha) \leq k(\alpha)$ for all $\alpha$; conclude that $h(S_\alpha) \neq E$ for all $\alpha$.] 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} We can assume $E\ne\varnothing$. Let $e_0$ be in $E$. Let $x$ be in $J$. We define $h:J\to E$ as in the hint. 

\noi Claim 1: $h(x)\le k(x)$ for all $x$. 

\noi Claim 2: $h(y)\le k(y)$ for all $y$ in $S_x$ implies $h(S_x)\ne E$. 

\noi Proof of Claim 2. For all $y$ in $S_x$ we have $h(y)\le k(y)<k(x)$, and in particular $k(x)\ne h(y)$. This implies $k(x)\notin h(S_x)$. 

\noi Proof of Claim 1. Assume by contradiction $h(x)>k(x)$ for some $x$. We can assume that $x$ is minimum for this condition. For $y<x$ we have $h(y)\le k(y)$, hence $h(S_x)\ne E$ by Claim~2.  

Claims 1 and 2 imply $h(x)=\min(h(S_x)^c)$ for all $x$, hence $h$ is increasing and $h(J)$ is downward closed by Supplementary Exercise 11.2 above, hence $J$ has the order type of $E$ or a section of $E$.

    \item[(a)] If $A$ and $B$ are well-ordered sets, then exactly one of the following three conditions holds: $A$ and $B$ have the same order type, or $A$ has the order type of a section of $B$, or $B$ has the order type of a section of $A$. [Hint: Form a well-ordered set containing both $A$ and $B$, as in Exercise 8 of Â§10; then apply the preceding exercise.]
    \item[(b)] Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are well-ordered sets that are uncountable, such that every section of $A$ and of $B$ is countable. Show $A$ and $B$ have the same order type.
\end{enumerate} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} (a) For any element $x$ of any ordered set $X$, let $X_{<x}$ denote the corresponding section, and let us set $X_{<\infty}:=X$. Let $C$ be the well-ordered set containing both $A$ and $B$, described in Exercise~8 of Â§10, and let $k:A\to C$ and $\ell:B\to C$ be the natural increasing maps. By the previous Exercise, we have isomorphisms $A\simeq C_{<x}$ and $B\simeq C_{<y}$ for some $x$ and $y$ in $C\cup\{\infty\}$. We can assume $x\le y$. Then $x=y$ implies $A\simeq B$. If $x<y$, we get 
$$
A\simeq C_{<x}=(C_{<y})_{<x}\subsetneq C_{<y}\simeq B.
$$ 
This implies $A\simeq B_{<b}$ for some $b$ in $B$. The fact that the various cases are exclusive follows from Supplementary Exercise 11.2b. 

\noi(b) Follows from (a). 

Here is an important consequence of (a): 

\begin{thm}[Comparability Theorem] 
If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then exactly one of the following three conditions holds: 

\emph{(i)} there is a bijection $A\to B$, 

\emph{(ii)} there is an injection $A\to B$ and a surjection $B\to A$, 

\emph{(iii)} there is an injection $B\to A$ and a surjection $A\to B$.

\noi\textbf{Solution.} The fact that the well-ordering theorem implies the maximum principle is proved on p.~70 of the book. Let us prove the converse. In the setting of Supplementary Exercise~11.5b, take $\mc B$ maximal. Then it suffices to show that $B'=X$.

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Supplementary Exercise 11.7 p. 73 of the book.} Use Exercises 1--5 to prove the following: 

\noi\textbf{Theorem.} The choice axiom is equivalent to the well-ordering theorem.

\noi Proof. Let $X$ be a set; let $c$ be a fixed choice function for the nonempty subsets of $X$. If $T$ is a subset of $X$ and $<$ is a relation on $T$, we say that $(T, <)$ is a tower in $X$ if $<$ is a well-ordering of $T$ and if for each $x \in T$,
\[x = c(X - S_x(T)),\]
where $S_x(T)$ is the section of $T$ by $x$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Let $(T_1, <_1)$ and $(T_2, <_2)$ be two towers in $X$. Show that either these two ordered sets are the same, or one equals a section of the other. [Hint: Switching indices if necessary, we can assume that $h: T_1 \to T_2$ is order preserving and $h(T_1)$ equals either $T_2$ or a section of $T_2$. Use Exercise~2 to show that $h(x) = x$ for all $x$.]
    \item[(b)] If $(T, <)$ is a tower in $X$ and $T \neq X$, show there is a tower in $X$ of which $(T, <)$ is a section.
    \item[(c)] Let $\{(T_k, <_k)|k \in K\}$ be the collection of all towers in $X$. Let
    \[T = \bigcup_{k\in K} T_k \text{ and } <\ = \bigcup_{k\in K} (<_k).\]
    Show that $(T, <)$ is a tower in $X$. Conclude that $T = X$.
\end{enumerate} 

\noi\textbf{Solution.} (a) The map $h$ in the hint exists by Supplementary Exercise~4a. Let us show $h(x)=x$ for all $x$ thanks to Supplementary Exercise~2. Assume by contradiction that we have $h(x)\ne x$ for some $x$ in $T_1$, which we can suppose to be minimum for this condition. The map $h$ induces an isomorphism $T_1\simeq h(T_1)$, implying $h(T_{1,<y})=T_{2,h(y)}$ for all $y$ in $T_1$. By the choice of $x$ we get $T_{1,<x}=T_{2,<h(x)}$. Since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are towers, this entails 
$$
h(x)=c(X\sm T_{2,<h(x)})=c(X\sm T_{1,<x})=x,
$$ 
contradiction. The fact that $h(x)=x$ for all $x$ in $T_1$ implies, by Supplementary Exercise 11.2a, that $T_1$ is contained and downward closed in $T_2$. 

\noi(b) Add $c(X\sm T)$ to $T$, and make it the largest element. 

\noi(c) Left to the reader. 

This shows that the choice axiom implies the well-ordering theorem. The converse is clear.

\noi\textbf{Lemma 13.1 p. 80 of the book.} Recall the statement: 

\begin{lem}[Lemma 13.1 p. 80 of the book]\label{L13.1}
Let $X$ be a set; let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis for a topology $\mathcal{T}$ on $X$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ equals the collection of all unions of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.
\end{lem}

Here is the proof given in the book: 

\begin{proof}
Given a collection of elements of $\mathcal{B}$, they are also elements of $\mathcal{T}$. Because $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology, their union is in $\mathcal{T}$. Conversely, given $U \in \mathcal{T}$, choose for each $x\in U$ an element $B_x$ of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $x\in B_x \subset U$. Then $U=\bigcup_{x\in U}B_x$, so $U$ equals a union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.
\end{proof} 

To avoid the Axiom of Choice when showing that $U \in \mathcal{T}$ is a union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$, just note that $U$ is the union of all those $B$ in $\mc B$ which are contained in  $U$. 

%This kind of unnecessary use of the Axiom of Choice occurs several times in the book. To avoid repetitions we state the following Lemma. \begin{lem}[Avoiding the Axiom of Choice]\label{LAOC}Let $X$ be a topological space, $A$ a subset. Then $A$ is open if and only if for all $x$ in $A$ there is an open subset $U$ such that $x\in U\subset A$. \end{lem}

\noi Claim: $(-1,1)\sm K\notin\mc T_\ell$. Proof. If not we would have $0\in[a,b)\subset(-1,1)\sm K\subset[2,3)$ for some $a$ and $b$, hence $a\le0<b$, hence $a<\frac1n<b$ for some $n$, contradiction. 

\hs

\noi$\bullet$ \textbf{Solution to Exercise 13.7 p. 83 of the book.} Let us use the following notation: 

$\T_s:=$ standard topology, 

$\T_K:=$ topology of $\R_K$, 

$\T_{fc}:=$ finite complement topology, 

$\T_u:=$ upper limit topology (having the sets $(a,b]$ as basis), 

$\T_\infty:=$ topology having the sets $(-\infty,a)$ as basis. 

\noi We denote the corresponding topological spaces by $\R_s,\R_K,\R_{fc},\R_u$ and $\R_\infty$. Finally we write $\B_s,\B_K,\B_u$ and $\B_\infty$ for the obvious bases. 

The inclusions between these five topologies on $\R$ can be summarized by the diagram 
$$
\begin{matrix}
&u\\ 
&K\\ 
&s\\ 
fc&&\infty,
\end{matrix}
$$ 
where ``$i$ below $j$'' means ``$\T_i\subsetneq\T_j$''\footnote{I denote inclusion by $\subset$ and proper inclusion by $\subsetneq$. I know that, in some sense, it would be more coherent to use $\subseteq$ for inclusion, but I prefer to do it that way, and hope the reader will not be confused.}, and ``$i$ and $j$ on the same level'' means ``$\T_i$ and $\T_j$ are incomparable''. 

Preliminary comments: It is easy to see that the elements of $\T_\infty$ are $\varnothing$, the intervals $(-\infty,a)$, and $\R$, and to observe that $\T_\infty\cap\T_{fc}=\{\varnothing,\R\}$. It is also easy to compare the standard topology $\T_s$ to the others: the elements of $\T_{fc}$ and $\T_\infty$ are clearly open in $\R_s$, and it is plain that the intervals $(a,b)$ (which are the elements on $\B_s$) are open in $\R_K$ and in $\R_\infty$ (note that $(a,b)=\bigcup_{d<b}(a,d])$. Clearly, $(-1,1)\sm K\in\T_K$ and $(a,b]\in\T_u$ are not open in $\R_s$. Moreover $(2,3]$ is in $\T_u$ but not in $\T_K$. So, it only remains to prove $\T_K\subset\T_u$. 

Let $x$ be in $(a,b)\sm K$. It suffices to show that there is a $c$ such that $x\in(c,x]\subset(a,b)\sm K$. If $x\le0$ we set $c:=a$. If $\frac1{n+1}<x<\frac1n$ we set $c:=\frac1{n+1}\,$. If $x>1$ we set $c:=\max(1,a)$.

\noi\textbf{Subspace topology p. 88 of the book.} Munkres writes: 

\noi\textbf{Definition.} Let $X$ be a topological space with topology $\mathcal{T}$. If $Y$ is a subset of $X$, the collection
\[
\mathcal{T}_Y = \{Y \cap U \mid U \in \mathcal{T}\}
\]
is a topology on $Y$, called the \textbf{subspace topology}. With this topology, $Y$ is called a \textbf{subspace} of $X$; its open sets consist of all intersections of open sets of $X$ with $Y$. %\vspace{10pt}

It is easy to see that $\mathcal{T}_Y$ is a topology. It contains $\varnothing$ and $Y$ because
\[
\varnothing = Y \cap \varnothing \quad \text{and} \quad Y = Y \cap X,
\]
where $\varnothing$ and $X$ are elements of $\mathcal{T}$. The fact that it is closed under finite intersections and arbitrary unions follows from the equations
\[
(U_1 \cap Y) \cap \cdots \cap (U_n \cap Y) = (U_1 \cap \cdots \cap U_n) \cap Y,
\]
\[
\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} (U_\alpha \cap Y) = \left(\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha\right) \cap Y.
\] 

\begin{proof}
Given a collection of elements of $\mathcal{B}$, they are also elements of $\mathcal{T}$. Because $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology, their union is in $\mathcal{T}$. Conversely, given $U \in \mathcal{T}$, choose for each $x \in U$ an element $B_x$ of $\mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B_x \subset U$. Then $U = \bigcup_{x\in U} B_x$, so $U$ equals a union of elements of $\mathcal{B}$.
\end{proof} 

\noi End of the excerpt. 

The Axiom of Choice is used to handle arbitrary unions. One can avoid it by proceeding as follows. 

Given $A\subset Y\subset X$, set $\mc U:=\{U\in\mc T\ |\ U\cap Y\subset A\}$, and define the open subset $U_A$ of $X$ by $U_A:=\bigcup_{U\in\mc U}U$. Then we have 
$$
A\subset U_A\iff U_A\cap Y=A.
$$ 
Proof: We have $Y\cap U_A=Y\cap\bigcup_{U\in\mc U}U=\bigcup_{U\in\mc U}Y\cap U\subset A$, so 
$$A=U_A\cap Y\iff A\subset U_A\cap Y\iff A\subset U_A.\qquad\square
$$
And we decree that $A$ is open in $Y$ if and only if the above equivalent conditions are satisfied. This is equivalent to the usual definition. Proof: If $A=U_A\cap Y$, then $A$ is open in $Y$ in the usual sense. If $A=U\cap Y$ for some $U$ open in $X$, then $U\in\mc U$, hence $U\subset U_A$, and we get $A=U\cap Y\subset U_A\cap Y\subset A$, hence $A=U_A\cap Y$. Observe that, in general, $U_A\cap Y$ is the \textbf{interior} of $A$ in $Y$. 

Note that things are even nicer if we use closed subsets instead of open ones. Indeed, given $A\subset Y\subset X$ as above, there is a least closed subset $C_A$ of $X$ such that $A\subset C_A\cap Y$, and $C_A$ is the closure of $A$ in $X$. What I find remarkable is that $C_A$ depends only on $A$ and $X$, but not on $Y$. (I don't know if there is a conceptual reason for that.) (To see that $U_A$ depends on $Y$ in general, let $X$ be nonempty and let $A$ be empty. If $Y=\varnothing$, then $U_A=X$, but if $Y=X$, then $U_A=\varnothing$.) \bigskip

\begin{thm}[Theorem 17.2 p. 94 of the book]\label{T17.2} 
Let $X$ be a topological space, $Y$ a subspace, and $A$ a subset of $Y$. Then $A$ is closed in $Y$ if and only $A=Y\cap C$ for some closed subset of $X$. 
\end{thm} 

\begin{proof} 
It suffices to show that $Y\sm A=Y\cap U$, where $U$ is an open subset of $X$, if and only if $A=Y\cap(X\sm U)$. Hence it is enough to prove that we have $Y\sm(Y\cap U)=Y\cap(X\sm U)$, or equivalently $Y\sm U=Y\cap(X\sm U)$, for all subset $U$ of $X$. But this is clear.

\begin{thm}[Theorem 17.4 p. 95 of the book] 
Let $X$ be a topological space, $Y$ a subspace, and $A$ a subset of $Y$. Then the closure $\overline A^Y$ of $A$ in $Y$ equals $\overline A\cap Y$, where $\overline A$ is the closure of $A$ in $X$.
\end{thm} 

Here is a slightly different proof.

Set

\mc B=\{B\ |\ B\text{ closed in }Y,\ B\supset A\}.

For all $B$ in $\mc B$ put

\mc C(B)=\{C\ |\ C\text{ closed in }X,\ C\supset B\}.

Finally write 
$$
\mc C=\{C\ |\ C\text{ closed in }X,\ C\supset A\}.

\mc C=\bigcup_{B\in\mc B}\mc C(B)

\overline A^Y=\bigcap_{B\in\mc B}B=\bigcap_{B\in\mc B}\bigcap_{C\in\mc C(B)}(Y\cap C)=\bigcap_{C\in\mc C}(Y\cap C)=Y\cap\bigcap_{C\in\mc C}C=Y\cap\overline A.

Let $A$ be a subset of the topological space $X$; let $A'$ be the set of all limit points of $A$. Then $\overline A=A\cup A'$. 
\end{thm} 

Here is a slightly different proof. 

\begin{proof}
In this proof we denote the closure $\overline B$ of a subset $B$ of $X$ by $B^-$. To show $A'\subset A^-$, note that if $x$ is in $A'$, then $x$ is in $(A\sm\{x\})^-\subset A^-$. It only remains to prove $A^-\subset A\cup A'$. Assume by contradiction that there is an $x$ in $A^-$ which is not in $A\cup A'$. We have in particular $x\notin(A\sm\{x\})^-$, that is, $x\in U:=X\sm(A\sm\{x\})^-$ with $U$ open. The fact that $x$ is in $\overline A$ implies that $U$ intersects $A$. Let $a$ be such an intersection point. Since $x$ is not in $A$ but $a$ is, we have $a\ne x$, hence $a$ is in $A\sm\{x\}$, which is disjoint from $U$, contradiction.

Here is a slightly different proof. 

\begin{proof}
It suffices to show that the following two conditions are equivalent: 

(1) there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U\cap A=\{x\}$, 

(2) there is a neighborhood $V$ of $x$ such that $V\cap A$ is finite. 

\noi Clearly (1) implies (2). To prove the converse it suffices to set $U:=(V\sm A)\cup\{x\}$. (Since $X$ is $T_1$, the subset $V$, being obtained from $U$ by removing finitely many points, is open.)

Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces; let $f: X \to Y$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$(1)$] $f$ is continuous.
    \item[$(2)$] For every subset $A$ of $X$, one has $f(\overline{A}) \subset \overline{f(A)}$.
    \item[$(3)$] For every closed set $B$ of $Y$, the set $f^{-1}(B)$ is closed in $X$.
    \item[$(4)$] For each $x \in X$ and each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x)$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U) \subset V$.
\end{itemize}
If the condition in $(4)$ holds for the point $x$ of $X$, we say that $f$ is \textbf{continuous at the point} $x$.

The proof that (4) implies (1) is written as follows: ``Let $V$ be an open set of $Y$; let $x$ be a point of $f^{-1}(V)$. Then $f(x) \in V$, so that by hypothesis there is a neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $f(U_x) \subset V$. Then $U_x \subset f^{-1}(V)$. It follows that $f^{-1}(V)$ can be written as the union of the open sets $U_x$, so that it is open.'' One can avoid using the Axiom of Choice by the following wording: $f^{-1}(V)$ can be written as the union of the open sets $U$ such that $x\in U\subset f^{-1}(V)$, so that it is open. (A similar comment was made after Lemma~\ref{L13.1}.)
